> Stringz is a lightweight yet powerful tool that makes translating your Xcode projects(iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS) easy and relieble.

✏️ Description
</h2>

Stringz greatly simplifies localizing your Xcode apps (iOS, macOS, tvOS and watchOS) by introducing a powerful editor for all localizable files in your project.
It will even import strings from storyboard and xib files saving you a lot of time and effort finding the element id in the storyboard.
Stringz also supports localizing your Info.plist file so you can easily translate your app name and permission descriptions.

Stringz will also highlight missing translations and warn you about duplicate values and has many more useful features that takes a painful and tedious task like localizing your app and converts it to an easy and fast task.

## Dependencies


## Important
Stringz still in its **beta versions**. Your app is amazing and i don't want it to get ruined because of me, so please do what any cautious developer would do and make a commit before using Stringz or (if you don't have version control in your app) make a backup of your app.

## Contributions
Stringz is my first macOS project so if you run into some messy code please don't judge instead create a pull request into `development` branch and i will be more than happy to merge it (Explaining what you changed and why would be highly appreciated).

## License
Stringz is available under the MIT license. See the LICENSE file for more information. -->
